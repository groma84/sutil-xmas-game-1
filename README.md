## What's next
- refactoring Sound management with useful types instead of strings and tuples
- adding "components" and "systems" (think ECS-based architecture)
- defining a level
- rendering a level
- moving the player
- "collision detection"
- collecting things
- ogres and ogre movement
- player health and attacks
- ogre attacks
- losing the game
- leaving the level

## Requirements
I tested it with:
- Windows 10

- Chrome 95

## Running it
- The first time: `dotnet tool restore && npm install`
- Afterwards just: `npm run start`
